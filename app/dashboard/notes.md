## Tech & Langs I want to use
List of tech I want to use in either the projects above or in the future:
### JS Slop
- [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/tutorial-first-app) & [Electron Vite](https://electron-vite.org/)
Web Dev Tings:
- [x] [Astro.js](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/1-setup/): Using for portfolio site; Might use for making an ecommerce site
### Lang Stuff
Functional:
- [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) but only after reading [SICP](obsidian://open?vault=G%20Drive&file=Programming%2FMath%2C%20CS%20%26%20Other%20Textbooks)
Langs:
- [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) was talked about it [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/ucp688/where_to_start_for_selflearning_of_the_basics/). It's based off Scheme which is the original language for the SICP book.
- I want to use [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/overview) to do the 1st part of the crafting interpreters book.
- TCL
# Current Projects
This is a list of projects/project ideas that I want to make or am currently making
- [x] ~~TypeSprint~~: 
	- API didn't work how I thought it did. Article on the topic used custom packages that I don't want to use.
- [x] GainsGraphed
	- Stopped due to the fact that I would need to pay the $100 Apple tax to actually upload the app which means I would have to wait to use the app. Also would rather focus on Web Dev tech instead of having to learn RN
- [x] [SnugWork](obsidian://open?vault=G%20Drive&file=Programming%2FWeb%26App%2FSnugWork): 
	- Finished and am doing incremental upgrades every now and then
- [x] [Portfolio Site](obsidian://open?vault=G%20Drive&file=Programming%2FWeb%26App%2FPortfolio%20Site...again)
- [ ] [Browser Engine](obsidian://open?vault=G%20Drive&file=Programming%2FLangs%2FBrowser%20Engine)
- [ ] [Cuaba Lang](obsidian://open?vault=G%20Drive&file=Programming%2FLangs%2FCuaba%20-%20Compiled%20Language)
- [ ] "Ring" Camera
- [ ] Guitar Pedals
